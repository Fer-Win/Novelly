Novelly is a simple application that can help you to make beautiful images of your code to be able to share your code in different social platforms.
This application was built as a project for [Saturday Hack Nights](https://hacknight.tinkerhub.org) by [TinkerHub](https://join.tinkerhub.org)

## Product 
[Novelly](https://novelly-navy.vercel.app)
## How it Works ?
As soon as the application is opened, prompts are shown on what to do. You need to press ``` and the Enter to create a code block in which you can paste your code.
There is a download button which allows you to download the image of the code you entered in the code block which then can be shared in different social media platforms.
